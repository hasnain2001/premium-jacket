            <p>Any wardrobe is simply incomplete without a great leather jacket. A search for a good leather jacket is exactly where The Hide Leather Style started, when some friends and I were in the market, looking for leather jackets ourselves.</p>
            <p>After much digging and research, it turned out that the explanation for higher prices of leather outerwear was a long supply chain of distributors, wholesalers, retailers coupled with costly marketing campaigns. This meant only a minute fraction of the price consumers paid went into the product itself.</p>
          <p>We could identify that the problem was solvable and consumers like us deserve better, so we started The Hide Leather Style.</p>
          <p>The challenge we took on ourselves was simple, make it easy for people to buy high quality leather jacket at accessible pricing.</p>
          <p>By cutting out the unnecessary expenses, designing and manufacturing in-house, selling directly to consumers and utilizing just-in-time production we are able to provide higher quality leather jackets at a fraction of market price.</p>
          <p>We know that electrifying feeling of wearing a leather jacket and believe everyone has the right to have that feeling.
        </p>
        <p>In our collection, we offer leather vests for men and women in a range of colors, including distressed leather vests, vintage leather vests, slim-fit leather vests, plus-size leather vests, embroidered leather vests, sleeveless leather vests, suede leather vests. Each vest is crafted from the finest leather materials and is tailored for maximum comfort and style.</p>
        We also deal in real sheepskin shearling jackets, shearling coats, and aviator jackets which will keep you warm and fashionable during the winter months. Shearling bomber jackets, cropped fur leather jackets, vintage fur vests, real fur-lined jackets, and many more can be found in our collection.

                <h2>Finest Raw Materials</h2>
                <p>It all starts with the raw materials and since we carry our life in our jackets, we donâ€™t use anything but only the best possible materials. All our jackets are made with full grain natural leather, YKK zippers, and polyester lining.</p>
